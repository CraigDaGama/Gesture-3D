## ‚úãüéÆ Gesture3D ‚Äî Real-Time Hand Gesture Controlled 3D Interaction

---

### üß† Overview

**Gesture3D** is a Python desktop application that transforms your hand into a virtual controller. Using just a standard webcam, you can **pinch, grab, rotate, and move a 3D object on your screen** ‚Äî all with natural hand gestures.

Built using [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html) for AI-based hand tracking, **Gesture3D** aims to deliver an intuitive, controller-free interface for interacting with 3D virtual objects in real time.

### üß† How It Works

| Gesture                   | Action               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Pinch (thumb + index tip) | Grab the object      |
| Move hand while pinching  | Move object position |
| Twist wrist               | Rotate the 3D object |
| Release pinch             | Drop the object      |
